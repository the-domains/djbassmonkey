  In addition to creating and mixing beats, I periodically mix spices and
  develop my own recipes. Here is a completely vegan szechuan sauce with minimal
  oil for a spicy stir-fry.    In three tablespoons of vegetable broth,
  simmer:    minced garlic – 1 tablespoon  minced ginger – 1 tablespoon (or
  about a two inch knob of skinned minced ginger root)  Its hard to have to much
  ginger and garlic, but its easy to not have enough.    Once that has simmered
  for 2 or 3 minutes add the following:    2 tablespoons of soy sauce  1
  tablespoon of rice wine vinegar  1 tablespoon of Szechuan chili paste  2
  tablespoons of hoison sauce  3/4 cup of vegetable broth  1 tablespoon of corn
  starch  Let this simmer for 5 minutes of so.    The sauce can be stored in the
  fridge for a couple of days or used immediately. I usually just stir-fry red
  and green peppers, onions, mushrooms and baby bok-choy with it, but it goes
  well with just about anything you can stir-fry.    Enjoy!

In addition to creating and mixing beats, I periodically mix spices and develop my own recipes. Here is a completely vegan szechuan sauce with minimal oil for a spicy stir-fry.   
  
In three tablespoons of vegetable broth, simmer:

minced ginger -- 1 tablespoon (or about a two inch knob of skinned minced ginger root)   
Its hard to have to much ginger and garlic, but its easy to not have enough.
